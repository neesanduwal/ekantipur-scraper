1) Create a minimal Playwright Python script using sync_playwright that opens Chromium (headless=False), navigates to https://ekantipur.com, waits for the page to load, and then closes the browser. Add clear comments but do not scrape anything yet.

2) Update the Playwright script to click on the entertainment section labeled “मनोरञ्जन” on ekantipur.com and wait properly for the entertainment news articles to load. Do not extract any data yet.

3) Based on ekantipur.com’s entertainment section, help identify a stable CSS selector that represents a single news article card. Prefer semantic HTML or data attributes and avoid fragile XPaths.

4) (Yes) Adjust the Playwright wait to use the stable article-card selector.

5) Using Playwright in Python, extract only the titles of the top 5 entertainment news articles from the entertainment section and print them to the console. Do not extract images, categories, or authors yet.

6) Extend the existing Playwright code to also extract the thumbnail image URL for each of the top 5 entertainment articles. Ensure the image URL is a full absolute URL even if the src attribute is relative or lazy-loaded.

7) Update the extraction logic to include the category/section label and the author name for each entertainment article. If the author element is not found, return null instead of throwing an error.

8) Help structure the extracted entertainment news data into a Python list of dictionaries with the keys: title, image_url, category, and author. Do not write to a JSON file yet.

9) Help identify a reliable selector for the “Cartoon of the Day” (व्यंग्यिचत्र) section on ekantipur.com and explain how to extract its title, image URL, and author using Playwright.

11) Using Playwright Python, extract the Cartoon of the Day’s title, direct image URL, and cartoonist name from ekantipur.com. Handle missing elements safely.

12) Show how to write the extracted entertainment news list and cartoon of the day data into a valid output.json file using Python. Ensure ensure_ascii=False so Nepali text is preserved and match the required JSON structure exactly.

13) Nono dont make changes in scraper.py i have made a seprate json file named output makes changes in that fiole.

14) Review the Playwright scraping script and suggest improvements for readability, comments, waiting strategies, and error handling without changing the overall logic.

15) Run this project.

16) Now in prompt.txt list all the prompts i have used to create this project.
